               <h3><b>What is Join?</b></h3>
               <p>
                  Join is a kanban board is a visual management tool used to help teams track and
                  prioritize tasks in a workflow. The board is divided into columns that represent
                  different stages of the workflow, and tasks are represented as cards that are
                  moved from one column to the next as they progress. This allows teams to have a
                  clear and up-to-date view of what work is in progress, what needs to be done next,
                  and what has been completed. The use of a kanban board helps teams to manage work
                  more efficiently, reduce bottlenecks and improve communication.

               <h3><b>How to use it</b></h3>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <b>Define Workflow</b>: Start by defining the workflow for your projects or
                     tasks, breaking them down into individual steps or stages. Assign each step to
                     a specific column on the kanban board.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Add Cards</b> : Add work items to the board as cards, assigning each card to
                     the appropriate column based on its current status in the workflow.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Move Cards</b> : Move the cards from column to column as the work
                     progresses, updating the board in real-time to reflect the current status of
                     each work item. Use the board to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and make
                     informed decisions about what work to tackle next.
